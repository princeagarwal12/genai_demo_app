Unpacking
Please unpack your upholstery carefully! Sharp objects can tear your upholstery.

Cleaning Tips
Always address spills immediately to prevent permanent staining. Your product should have a tag with one of the following letters to indicate the necessary treatment for your upholstery:

W: Only use water-based detergents.
S: Only use dry, solvent-based cleaners
S/W: Use either water-based or dry, solvent-based cleaners
X: Only vacuum. All cleaning should be done by a professional.
Note: Please consult your owner’s manual if this information is not present on your tag.

Suede
Vacuum your piece monthly to keep the suede looking like new.
Use a nylon brush to remove any dirt or food.
Contact a professional annually for a deep clean.
Stubborn Stains
Blot stains with a damp cloth and a dash of dish soap.
Wipe away excess water with a clean towel.
Let the material air-dry fully before use.
Additional Tips
Vacuum to remove any loose crumbs or dirt.
Have a pet? Use a lint roller to gather up any fur.
Preventative Care
Rotate pillows and cushions monthly to ensure even wear.
