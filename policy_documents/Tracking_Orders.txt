How do I track my package?
To quickly see an estimated delivery date, navigate to My Orders. Each item (plus all the information you might need to know about it) will have its current status and estimated arrival date. From there, the exact location of your item can be found by clicking “Track Your Package.”

On the “Track Your Package” page, you can opt in or out of text notifications to get real-time updates about the status of your order. Either way, we’ll keep you in the loop and send you a confirmation email with all the tracking information as soon as the item has shipped!

Visit our Shipping Information article for more details on item sizes, delivery dates, and shipping methods.

What is an estimated delivery date and how do I find it?
If you are interested in finding the estimated delivery date for an item before you place an order, just expand the “Shipping & Returns” tab on the item’s product page.

If you have placed an order, please note that estimated delivery dates vary depending on whether it is a small item or a large item:

Small Items

The estimated delivery date indicates when the item will arrive at your home.

Large Items

The estimated arrival date shows when the item will get to your local area.

A local Delivery Agent will then contact you to set up an exact delivery date and time window.

On your scheduled delivery date, our local delivery partner will call you 30 minutes prior to arrival to make sure you are home.
