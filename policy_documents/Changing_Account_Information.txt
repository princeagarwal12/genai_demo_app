How do I update my email subscriptions?
To unsubscribe or receive fewer emails, click "Email Subscriptions" on the My Account page, where you’ll be given the option to "Unsubscribe from all." If you don't see this option, it means you aren’t subscribed to promotional emails.

Note: You must be signed into your Wayfair Account to unsubscribe.

It may take up to 48 hours for any changes to be applied. We’ll continue to send emails about your shipping, delivery, and order information, regardless of your email subscription.
