How do I cancel an order?
You can request to cancel any order before it ships from My Orders. Cancellation requests are not a guarantee, as we’re unable to cancel items once they are preparing for shipment.

If you missed the window to cancel the order, you can always set up a return before it’s delivered, and then send the item back once it arrives.

What if my order cancelation is denied?
If you wish to keep your item(s) there is no further action needed.

If you wish to return your unwanted item(s) you can do so once you have received your item(s). To get started, view your recent orders and select the item you want to return.

Canceling a Handy or Home Service
Assembly or installation services can be rescheduled for free up to 24 hours before your scheduled appointment. Fees may apply for appointments that are canceled or rescheduled within 24 hours of the start time.
