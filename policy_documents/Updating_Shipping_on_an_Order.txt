How can I update the details of my order before it has shipped?
You can easily edit the details of your order online before it has shipped. From My Orders, you have the options to cancel the order, change the delivery method, or modify the shipping address for each item.

What should I do if I want to make changes to an order that is already in transit?
If an item has already shipped, there are a few additional steps required to make adjustments. Unfortunately, items that are already in transit cannot be expedited.

Can I update an order shipped by FedEx or UPS?
Yes, if you have a FedEx or UPS tracking number, you can update your order through FedEx Delivery Manager or UPS My Choice. These services offer various options such as holding or delaying packages, picking up from a local FedEx or UPS location, delivering to another address, choosing delivery on another day, scheduling a delivery window, and signing for packages online.

How can I make changes to an order shipped by carriers other than FedEx or UPS?
If your item is not being shipped by FedEx or UPS, it is considered a large item. You can still make changes to the order. Here are the options available for orders with large items:

Reschedule the delivery date and/or time window by following the instructions in your scheduled delivery date confirmation email. Please note that delivery dates cannot be adjusted within 24 hours of the scheduled delivery.

Change the delivery method by going to My Orders and selecting "Change Delivery Method." For more information on delivery method options, refer to the Delivery for Large Items section.
