What should I do if my package is marked “Delivered” but I didn’t receive it?
If you can't locate your package, don't worry! Most items turn up within three days. Here are some steps to try:

1 - Verify your shipping address.

Check that your shipping address is correct. You can find your current shipping address listed under "Deliver To:" on the My Orders page.

2 - Search around your home or building and check with neighbors.

Look in different areas like backdoors, behind bushes, or at the address next door. Sometimes packages are left in unexpected places.

3 - Give it three days.

Occasionally, carriers mistakenly scan packages as "Delivered" even if they are still in transit. Give it three days as your package may show up within that time frame despite the false scan.

4 - Check your mailbox or other mail-receiving locations.

Carriers may handle small packages differently, especially if they can fit inside your mailbox.

5 - Look for a notice of attempted delivery.

If a carrier attempted delivery but you were not available, they might have left a notice with instructions on how to receive your package.
