How do I use promo codes?
Promo codes can be applied on the payment page of checkout. Simply fill your cart with your favorite items and apply your code in the designated field. Your grand total will immediately reflect the discount.

Can promo codes be used for any purchase?
Promo codes apply to most of our products but may have some restrictions, based on time frame, type of product, or brand. Check our promo code exclusions to double-check if your promo code can be used. Please note, promo codes can only be applied during purchase. Customer service will be unable to honor any promotional code adjustments post-order.

Does Wayfair ever run sales or promotions?
We love a good deal as much as you do. Throughout the year, we offer very special promotions and discounts to our customers. We don't know if and when an item will go on sale, but when it does we can't wait to share the good news! Want to stay on top of our latest deals? Sign up for our daily or weekly sales emails.

Does Wayfair price match?
We strive to always bring you competitive prices, but we cannot match promotional prices or any price drops that occur during promotional periods because these are special supplier-sponsored discounts.
