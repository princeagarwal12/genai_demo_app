How do I purchase or use a gift card?
Visit our gift cards page to purchase digital, printable, and physical gift cards.

To use your gift card, visit the Redeem a Gift Card page and enter your gift card code. When you redeem it, we'll add the entire amount to your account. You can also redeem a gift card directly at checkout or via My Account.

Gift cards never expire, so simply apply your account balance in checkout when you're ready to use it. Visit your Account Balance page to see your remaining funds.

How does store credit work?
Store credit is an option for return refunds and discounts on existing orders. If you receive store credit (never expires!), it will appear as a payment option during the checkout process. It can pay for the entire order or a portion of the cost, depending on how much credit is available. You can check the status of your store credit anytime by logging into My Account.
